== Various scripts and stuff used for my blog ==

Attention: I've renamed the repo because of a typo in its name!

Index:

- a calendar component for sproutcore (currently only in Italian). See the screenshot in
  sproutcore/calendar/screenshot/

- a mixin that adds a close (round X) button on the top right corner of a palette pane
  Screenshot in: sproutcore/closable/screenshot/

Enjoy, Umberto.
